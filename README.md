# Mimic App

This is a basic app to allow text, audio and video chatting. It uses [Peer.js](http://peerjs.com).

## TODO

- Add voice support

## To try locally

You'll need to have Node.js installed.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:asood123/mimic.git
$ cd mimic
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 in two different windows and messages should pass back and forth.
